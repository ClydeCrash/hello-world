# hello-world
catch-all / admin / front-desk kind of place
Total GitHub noob here. I have a MS in computers, but that probably doesn't mean much here.
Leave me a message if you want to discuss dieselpunk fiction, Lego-type blocks, using Blender for animation, or where I can get a job that requires multiple and varied skills.
